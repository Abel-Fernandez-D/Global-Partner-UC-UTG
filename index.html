                In Peru and The Gambia, many young people still lack access to practical financial knowledge.
                That’s why we created an interactive word search that turns key concepts into an engaging game—making learning simple, fun, and relevant.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Let’s empower young people in Peru and The Gambia with the tools for a sustainable future!</strong>

                    <li data-word="SAVING">
                        <span class="keyword">Saving</span>
                        <div class="fact">
                            <strong>Definition:</strong>
                            <p>Saving is the part of a person's income that is not spent immediately, but instead kept for future needs. It helps people face unexpected expenses, reach personal goals, or build financial security over time.</p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>In Peru, a student may set aside a portion of their weekly allowance to buy school materials or save for a larger goal, such as continuing education.</em></li>
                                <li><em>In The Gambia, youth often create small savings groups with friends or neighbors to prepare for school expenses or future opportunities.</em></li>
                            </ul>

                    <li data-word="TAX">
                        <span class="keyword">Tax</span>
                        <div class="fact">
                            <strong>Definition:</strong>
                            <p>A tax is a mandatory payment made to the government on income, purchases, or property. These funds are used to support public services such as education, healthcare, roads, and security.</p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>In Peru, a young entrepreneur selling handmade crafts learns that once they earn above a certain amount, they must register and pay taxes on their income.</em></li>
                                <li><em>In The Gambia, understanding how sales taxes work helps young vendors price their goods correctly and stay compliant with local rules.</em></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </li>
            
                    <li data-word="ASSET">
                        <span class="keyword">Asset</span>
                        <div class="fact">
                            <strong>Definition:</strong>
                            <p>An asset is anything of value that a person or business owns, which can help generate income or be sold in the future. Assets can be physical (like land) or non-physical (like skills).</p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>In Peru, owning a bicycle used for deliveries or a set of tools for carpentry can be considered useful personal assets.</em></li>
                                <li><em>In The Gambia, a family may count a small piece of farmland or livestock as part of their valuable resources.</em></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <span class="keyword">Liability</span>
                        <div class="fact">
                            <strong>Definition:</strong>
                            <p>A liability is something that a person or business owes—like a loan, unpaid bill, or financial obligation. Managing liabilities responsibly is key to financial health.</p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>In Peru, a university student who receives a loan to pay for tuition must repay it over time, which becomes a personal liability.</em></li>
                                <li><em>In The Gambia, a young farmer who borrows seeds and tools for the planting season is responsible for repaying that debt after harvest.</em></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="fact">
                            <strong>Definition:</strong>
                            <p>A balance sheet is a financial summary showing what is owned (assets), what is owed (liabilities), and the difference between them (net worth), usually at a given time.</p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>In Peru, someone starting a small home business might use a simple balance sheet to track progress and organize their budget.</em></li>
                                <li><em>In The Gambia, local youth groups managing community projects often keep records to understand how much they have and what they owe.</em></li>

                            <strong>Definition:</strong>
                            <p>Supply refers to the amount of a product or service that sellers are willing and able to provide at different price levels.</p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>In Peru, during harvest time, an increase in vegetable supply at local markets often causes prices to drop.</em></li>
                                <li><em>In The Gambia, when fishing is good, more fish become available, and vendors adjust prices based on the quantity.</em></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <ul>
                                <li><em>In Peru, buying electronics often includes a warranty that allows the customer to return or fix the item if it fails.</em></li>
